# SLIs and SLOs with Prometheus and Grafana for your APIs managed by Tyk

## About

This is a demo project running on Docker, that shows how to configure [Tyk Gateway](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk), [Tyk Pump](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-pump), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana OSS](https://grafana.com/grafana/) to set-up a dashboard with SLIs and SLOs for your APIs managed by Tyk.

You can use it to explore the Prometheus metrics exposed by Tyk Pump and use them in a Grafana dashboard.

## Deploy and run the demo

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/TykTechnologies/demo-slo-prometheus-grafana.git
```

2. Start the services

```
cd ./demo-slo-prometheus-grafana/
docker compose up -d
```

3. Verify that all services are running

- Tyk Gateway
    - Health check runs on [http://localhost:8080/hello](http://localhost:8080/hello)
    - httpbin API runs on [http://localhost:8080/httpbin/](http://localhost:8080/httpbin/)
    - httpstatus API runs on [http://localhost:8080/status/](http://localhost:8080/status/)
- Tyk Pump
    - Health check runs on [http://localhost:8083/health](http://localhost:8083/health)
    - Prometheus metrics endpoint runs on [http://localhost:8084/metrics](http://localhost:8084/metrics)
- Prometheus runs on [http://localhost:9090/](http://localhost:9090/)
- Grafana OSS runs on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
    - The default log-in at start is admin/admin, once logged in you will be prompted for a new password

4. Generate traffic

[K6](https://k6.io/) is used to generate traffic to the API endpoints. The load script [load.js](./deployments/k6/load.js) will run for 15 minutes.

```
 docker compose run  k6 run /scripts/load.js
```

You will see K6 output in your terminal:

5. Check out the dashboard in Grafana

Go to [Grafana](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser (initial user/pwd: admin/admin) and open the dashboard called [*SLOs for APIs managed by Tyk*](./deployments/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/SLOs-for-APIs-managed-by-Tyk.json).

You should see the data coming in:

You can also filter the data per API:

## Tear down

Stop the services

```
docker compose stop
```

Remove the services

```
docker compose down
```

## How this works

### Configuration

* Tyk API Gateway is configured to expose two API endpoint:
  *  httpbin ([see .json config](./deployments/tyk-gateway/apps/httpbin.json))
  *  httpstatus ([see .json config](./deployments/tyk-gateway/apps/httpstatus.json))
* K6 will use the load script [load.js](./deployments/k6/load.js) to generate demo traffic to the API endpoints
* Tyk Pump is configured to expose a metric endpoint for Prometheus ([see config](./deployments/tyk-pump/pump.conf)) with two custom metrics called `tyk_http_requests_total` and `tyk_http_latency`. Tyk Pump version >= 1.6. is needed for custom metrics.
* Prometheus
  * [prometheus.yml](./deployments/prometheus/prometheus.yml) is configured to automatically scrape Tyk Pump's metric endpoint
  * [slos.rules.yml](./deployments/prometheus/slos.rules.yml) is used to calculate additional metrics needed for the remaining error budget
* Grafana
  * [prometheus_ds.yml](./deployments/grafana/provisioning/datasources/prometheus_ds.yml) is configured to connect Grafana automatically to Prometheus
  * [SLOs-for-APIs-managed-by-Tyk.json](./deployments/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/SLOs-for-APIs-managed-by-Tyk.json) is the dashboard definition


### SLIs and SLOs

Definition and example inspired from https://sre.google/workbook/slo-document/, https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/alerting-on-slos/ and https://github.com/google/prometheus-slo-burn-example/blob/master/prometheus/slos.rules.yml.

You will see different indicators displayed on the Grafana dashboard. 

To calculate the SLO and the displayed error budget remaining, we use the following SLI/SLO:
* SLI: the proportion of successful HTTP requests, as measured from Tyk API Gateway
  *  Any HTTP status other than 500â€“599 is considered successful.
  *  count of http_requests which do not have a 5XX status code divided by count of all http_requests
*  SLO: 95% successful requests

In [slos.rules.yml](./deployments/prometheus/slos.rules.yml) we calculate the rate of error per requests for the last 10 minute in `job:slo_errors_per_request:ratio_rate10m`. With `job:error_budget:remaining` we calculate the error budget remaining in percent. This is what we display in the Grafana dashboard. We use a threshold of 95% in the dashboard (every value below 95% is red).
