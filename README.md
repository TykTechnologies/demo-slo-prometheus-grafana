## About

This is a demo project, using an OSS deployment of Tyk Gateway, Tyk Pump, Prometheus, Grafana and K6 running on Docker. 
  
## Purpose

You can use it to explore the Prometheus metrics exposed by Tyk Pump in Grafana, to set-up SLIs and SLOs. 
  
## Deploy and run the demo

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/TykTechnologies/demo-slo-prometheus-grafana.git
```

2. Start the services

```
docker compose up -d
```

3. Verify that all services are running

- [Tyk Gateway](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk)
    - Health check runs on [http://localhost:8080/hello](http://localhost:8080/hello)
    - httpbin API runs on [http://localhost:8080/httpbin/](http://localhost:8080/httpbin/)
    - httpstatus API runs on [http://localhost:8080/users/](http://localhost:8080/users/)
- [Tyk Pump](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-pump)
    - Health check runs on [http://localhost:8083/health](http://localhost:8083/health)
    - Prometheus metrics endpoint runs on [http://localhost:8084/metrics](http://localhost:8084/metrics)
- Prometheus runs on [http://localhost:9090/](http://localhost:9090/)
- Grafana OSS runs on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
    - The default log-in at start is admin/admin, once logged in you will be prompted for a new password

4. Generate traffic

K6 is used to generate traffic to the API endpoints
The load script [load.js](./deployments/k6/load.js) will run for 15 minutes.

```
 docker compose run  k6 run /scripts/load.js
```

5. Check out the dashboard in Grafana



## Tear down

Stop the services

```
docker compose stop
```

Remove the services

```
docker compose down
```

## SLIs and SLOs


## Grafana


Go to [Grafana](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser and open the dashboard called *SLOs for APIs managed by Tyk*.

## SLIs and SLOs

Example definition inspired from: https://sre.google/workbook/slo-document/. See also https://sre.google/workbook/implementing-slos/#what-to-measure-using-slis and https://sre.google/workbook/alerting-on-slos/ to learn more about SLIs and SLOs.


__SLI: the proportion of successful requests, as measured from Tyk API Gateway__

* Any HTTP status other than 500â€“599 is considered successful.
* count of "api" http_requests which do not have a 5XX status code divided by count of all "api" http_requests

__SLO__

* 95% successful requests
