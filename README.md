# SLIs and SLOs with Prometheus and Grafana for your APIs

## About

This is a demo project running on Docker, that shows how to configure [Tyk Gateway](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk), [Tyk Pump](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-pump), Prometheus and Grafana to set-up a dashboard with SLIs and SLOs for your APIs managed by Tyk.

You can use it to explore the Prometheus metrics exposed by Tyk Pump and use them to set-up SLIs and SLOs in Grafana.

## Deploy and run the demo

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/TykTechnologies/demo-slo-prometheus-grafana.git
```

2. Start the services

```
cd ./demo-slo-prometheus-grafana/
docker compose up -d
```

3. Verify that all services are running

- Tyk Gateway
    - Health check runs on [http://localhost:8080/hello](http://localhost:8080/hello)
    - httpbin API runs on [http://localhost:8080/httpbin/](http://localhost:8080/httpbin/)
    - httpstatus API runs on [http://localhost:8080/status/](http://localhost:8080/status/)
- Tyk Pump
    - Health check runs on [http://localhost:8083/health](http://localhost:8083/health)
    - Prometheus metrics endpoint runs on [http://localhost:8084/metrics](http://localhost:8084/metrics)
- Prometheus runs on [http://localhost:9090/](http://localhost:9090/)
- Grafana OSS runs on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
    - The default log-in at start is admin/admin, once logged in you will be prompted for a new password

4. Generate traffic

K6 is used to generate traffic to the API endpoints. The load script [load.js](./deployments/k6/load.js) will run for 15 minutes.

```
 docker compose run  k6 run /scripts/load.js
```

You will see K6 output in your terminal:

5. Check out the dashboard in Grafana

Go to [Grafana](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser (initial user/pwd: admin/admin) and open the dashboard called *SLOs for APIs managed by Tyk*.

You should see the data coming in:

You can also filter the data per API:

## Tear down

Stop the services

```
docker compose stop
```

Remove the services

```
docker compose down
```

## How this works

TODO: work in progress

### Tyk Gateway

### Tyk Pump

### Prometheus

todo: add details about the query

Example definition inspired from: https://sre.google/workbook/slo-document/. See also https://sre.google/workbook/implementing-slos/#what-to-measure-using-slis and https://sre.google/workbook/alerting-on-slos/ to learn more about SLIs and SLOs.


__SLI: the proportion of successful requests, as measured from Tyk API Gateway__

* Any HTTP status other than 500â€“599 is considered successful.
* count of "api" http_requests which do not have a 5XX status code divided by count of all "api" http_requests
* SLO: 95% successful requests
